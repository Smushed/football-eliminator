## Football Eliminator
This game is a mix of daily and season long NFL fantasy. The goal is for you and your group to compete on a week to week basis on a game that lasts the entire season long. Every week each player sets a roster with the restriction that they cannot play anyone they have not already played previously.
<br />
<br />
<strong>For Example</strong>
- The first week you decide to play Patrick Mahomes. The rest of the season you must construct your rosters without Patrick Mahomes regardless of how he played in the first week, or if he has a better match up in the future.

The scoring of this game is total points. I plan on implementing head to head matchups in the future.

### How this game came to be
My dad, uncle and I are avvid fantasy football players and we played this game while running it out of excel. Since that was cumbersome, we dropped playing but spoke about playing again if it was simpler.

When I graduated from my bootcamp I decided to pick up the mantle of designing this game into a reality. In my head, this will always be a labor of love, something I never plan on monetizing. This is a game I plan on keeping local and playing with family and friends.

### Current Status
This project is currently on version 0.3.
In version 0.2 which is what was used during the 2020-2021 season I redesigned the database and structured it so it will be faster going forward.
In version 0.3 my focus is on useability and making the website appealing to use.

Some key features are listed below:

- Users can log in and pick a roster
- The weeks and seasons are displayed based on the current day
- The rosters lock before the Thursday game
- Users can see view others rosters
- There is a leaderboard to compare scores

### Future Ideas & Improvements
- Send out an email, or host a page for "Match Ups" a summary by week of the players each person is playing
- Add groups so users can organize any way they see fit
    - Add scoring for each group individually so they can customize their points & rosters
- Add D/ST as an option to be played
- Scores are displayed for players when a user looks back at their own roster over time
